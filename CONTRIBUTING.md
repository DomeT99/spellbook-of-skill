# Contributing to SpellBook of Skill

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. The goal of SpellBook of Skill is to collect useful, clear, and practical developer guides, organized in a simple and easy-to-browse structure.

## How to contribute a new guide

### 1. Check whether the guide already exists

Before adding a new one, make sure the topic is not already covered in the documentation to avoid duplicates or overly similar content.

### 2. Choose the right category

Add the new guide to one of the folders under src/content/docs, for example:

- Start Here
- Coding
- Content Creation

If the guide belongs to a new area, you can create a new folder with a clear and descriptive name.

### 3. Create an MDX file for the guide

Each guide should be saved as an .mdx file in the most appropriate folder. A sample structure is:

```mdx
---
title: Guide title
description: A short description of what the guide covers.
---

## Description

A description of the guide's intended use case.

## Guide

Step-by-step instructions...

## Example

Example of the expected output or project.

## Explanation

### Key Concepts

- Key point 1
- Key point 2

### Best Use Cases

- Use case 1
- Use case 2

### Tips to Get the Best Results

- Tip 1
- Tip 2
```

### 4. Follow these guidelines

To keep the collection consistent, each new guide should:

- have a clear and descriptive title;
- explain when and why to use it;
- include a step-by-step example with code;
- be concise and actionable;
- use clear placeholders such as `[topic]`, `[language]`, or `[platform]` when needed;
- avoid including sensitive data or real secrets.

### 5. Verify the result locally

Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

This ensures that the documentation and MDX files are generated correctly.

### 6. Open a pull request

When the guide is ready:

1. create a dedicated branch;
2. add the file or requested changes;
3. clearly describe what you added;
4. open a pull request with an explanatory title.
